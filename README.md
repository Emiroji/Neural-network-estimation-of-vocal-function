# Neural-network-estimation-of-vocal-function

The follow neural network architecture provide a mapping between the seven input features: amplitude of the unsteady glottal airflow (ACFL), maximum flow declination rate (MFDR), open quotient (OQ), speed quotient (SQ), spectral tilt measured as the log-magnitude difference between the first and second harmonics (H1-H2), fundamental frequency (fo), and the sound pressure level (SPL), an output layer composed of the four target vocal function measures: subglottal pressure (P_s), vocal fold collision pressure (P_c), and cricothyroid (a_CT) and thyroarytenoid (a_TA) muscle activation. This nonlinear mapping is trained solely with 13,000 Monte Carlo simulations (DataSetModel.cvs) obtained from low-order voice production model that utilizes a symmetric triangular body-cover model of the vocal folds.
